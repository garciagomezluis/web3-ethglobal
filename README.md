### Layeralize

Deploy layer-based NFTs collections on Polygon Mumbai

1. Create layers for your NFT collection (background, head, body, ...)
2. Layeralize them! Use the webapp to combine those layers based on the amount of times you want them to appear. This helps you to define the rariry of the assets.
3. Mint the collection to your address in Polygon Mumbai: images and NFT metadatas are stored in IPFS.
