# [Road To Web3 ETHGlobal Hackathon](https://web3.ethglobal.com/)

> Some changes need to be done regarding Moralis for this to work properly. Please check the [Project Site on ETHGlobal for more info](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/layeralize-g76hi).

### Layeralize

Deploy layer-based NFTs collections on Polygon Mumbai

1. Create layers for your NFT collection (background, head, body, ...)
2. Layeralize them! Use the webapp to combine those layers based on the amount of times you want them to appear. This helps you to define the rarity of the assets.
3. Mint the collection to your address in Polygon Mumbai: images and NFT metadatas are stored in IPFS.

Your ERC-1155 NFT Collection listed on OpenSea (testnet) as far as you can use the [webapp](https://olputa0a7acn.usemoralis.com/)!

Used:

* Deploy to Polygon Mumbai
* Moralis (sdk + host)

`npm run dev`
